# youtube-socialmedia-app
I built this site over a 2/3 week period (from what I can remember) & it allows users to sign up, like/dislike youtube videos, view the most popular videos, share videos to there wall, and more...
`This was built over a long long time ago :')`
This site is no where near finished :D Didn't spend that much time on it :P 

I built it for a bit of fun :) 

# Running
If you want to get it running , you need to import the `youtube.sql` into mysql, change the mysql connection details in `dal/connections/connections.php`

# Viewing
Main pages
- `http://localhost/funProjects/youtube/PHP/most-liked.php` - like, dislike, comment, and share.

Anyway...Not too much to see here. I just want to start showcasing some new and old code on github.
